Q4 Result
UC Irvine has a large repository for various kinds of data. In this problem, you are asked to use the iris dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) to
perform the experiments. Use the k-NN classifier for the classification task with k = 7. To begin one trial, randomly draw 70% of the samples for training and the rest for testing. Repeat the trials 10 times and compute the average accuracy. Note: you can directly import iris dataset by using sklearn without downloading from the UC Irvine repository.

Q5 Result
Repeat problem 4, but use 60% of the data as the training set, 20% as the validation set, and the rest 20% as the test set. Vary k from 3 to 11 and use the validation set to determine the best value of k. The value of k must be determined based on an average of 10 trials. Then, find the average accuracy of 10 trials based on the best k.
